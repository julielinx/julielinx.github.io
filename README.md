## Data Science Diaries

In going through data science books, tutorials, and blogs, I find that many of them have removed the nitty-gritty, messiness that is figuring out the problem and learning data science. I started these diary entries to record my own real world attempts as I deep dive into specific data science topics and processes. I hope other fledgling data scientists find these entries helpful.

The diary entries can be gone through in order, or can be used as I have been as quick reference material. They do build in complexity and build on lessons learned in previous entries, so take that into account.
